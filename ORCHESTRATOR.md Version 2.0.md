## Core Orchestration Methodology

### Task Decomposition Framework

Effective orchestration begins with systematic task decomposition that transforms complex requests into manageable subtasks optimally suited for specific AI agents. The decomposition framework employs a structured approach that considers task complexity, agent capabilities, and workflow dependencies to create efficient and effective execution plans.

The decomposition process starts with comprehensive request analysis that identifies the core objectives, success criteria, and constraints associated with the user's request. This analysis examines the scope and complexity of the required work, the types of outputs needed, and any specific requirements or limitations that must be considered. The analysis phase establishes the foundation for subsequent decomposition decisions and ensures that the resulting workflow addresses all aspects of the original request.

Following request analysis, the framework applies domain identification to categorize the different types of work required. Domain identification recognizes that complex requests often span multiple areas of expertise, such as research, analysis, synthesis, visualization, and implementation. By identifying the relevant domains, the framework can ensure that appropriate specialists are assigned to each component of the work.

The framework then proceeds with subtask definition, breaking down the overall request into specific, actionable components that can be effectively handled by individual agents. Subtask definition considers the natural boundaries between different types of work, the dependencies between different components, and the optimal sequencing of activities. Each subtask is defined with clear objectives, success criteria, and deliverable specifications to ensure effective execution.

Dependency mapping identifies the relationships between different subtasks and establishes the optimal sequencing for workflow execution. This mapping considers both logical dependencies, where one task must be completed before another can begin, and resource dependencies, where multiple tasks may compete for the same agent or require coordination to avoid conflicts. Dependency mapping ensures that the workflow can be executed efficiently while maintaining quality and coherence.

### Agent Assignment Strategy

Agent assignment represents a critical component of effective orchestration, requiring systematic evaluation of agent capabilities against task requirements to achieve optimal outcomes. The assignment strategy moves beyond simple capability matching to incorporate performance optimization, resource management, and quality assurance considerations.

The assignment process begins with capability assessment that evaluates each agent's strengths and limitations against the specific requirements of each subtask. This assessment considers not only the agent's primary capabilities but also its performance characteristics, output quality, and reliability for the specific type of work required. Capability assessment ensures that each subtask is assigned to an agent with the appropriate expertise and performance characteristics.

Performance optimization considers the quantitative performance metrics available for each agent, including benchmark scores, accuracy rates, and processing speeds. This optimization process selects agents that are most likely to deliver superior results for specific types of tasks based on empirical evidence rather than general capabilities. Performance optimization ensures that the workflow leverages the strongest available capabilities for each component of the work.

Resource management evaluates the practical constraints associated with each agent, including rate limits, subscription costs, response times, and availability restrictions. This evaluation ensures that the workflow can be executed within available resources while maintaining quality standards. Resource management also considers load balancing across agents to optimize overall workflow efficiency and avoid bottlenecks.

Quality assurance considerations evaluate each agent's reliability, consistency, and alignment with quality requirements for specific types of work. This evaluation considers factors such as output variability, error rates, and the need for human oversight or validation. Quality assurance ensures that the workflow design incorporates appropriate safeguards and validation mechanisms to maintain output quality.

### Prompt Engineering and Optimization

Prompt engineering represents a fundamental component of effective orchestration, requiring agent-specific optimization strategies that maximize output quality and consistency. The protocol incorporates advanced prompt engineering techniques based on empirical analysis of successful implementations and agent-specific performance characteristics.

The prompt engineering process begins with agent-specific template selection that leverages proven prompt structures optimized for each agent's unique characteristics and requirements. These templates incorporate the most effective prompt patterns, formatting requirements, and instruction structures for each agent based on extensive testing and real-world implementation data.

Context optimization ensures that each prompt includes all necessary information for effective task completion while avoiding information overload that can degrade performance. This optimization process considers each agent's context window limitations, processing characteristics, and information requirements to provide optimal context for task execution.

Output specification defines clear requirements for the format, structure, and content of expected outputs, ensuring that agent responses align with workflow requirements and can be effectively integrated with subsequent workflow stages. Output specification includes format requirements, quality criteria, and integration specifications that enable seamless workflow progression.

Iterative refinement procedures provide mechanisms for improving prompt effectiveness based on output quality and workflow performance. These procedures include feedback collection, prompt optimization, and performance monitoring that enable continuous improvement of prompt effectiveness over time.
